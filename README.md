-supports all normal functions EX. + - * / % ect.
-supports powers ex 2^2=4   2E2=2x10^2
-supports roots ex sqrt4=2    3root8=cuberoot8=2
-supports trig functions ex sin(pi)=0  asin0=pi
-supports logarithms ex log10=1  lne=1
-supports parentheses ex 2+((1+1)(8-6))=6  sqrt(2+2)=4
-you can create variables and use them ex b=3 then b+1=4    foo= (9-1)*2 then foo-1=15
-see all of your variables by typeing "mem"
-a label that displays the previous calculation
-you can go back and view previous calculations with up/down arrow keys
